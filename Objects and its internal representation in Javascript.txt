2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript


Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.

objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, etc and methods like updateAddress, updateNam, etc.

In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

Creating Objects in JavaScript:

*By object literal
*By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)
*By object literal:
*The syntax of creating object using object literal is given below:


Property and value is separated by colon(:).

Example:
  
           var person={
              fname:"xxx",
              lname:"yyy",
              age:25
             };

By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword):
The syntax of creating object directly is given below:
 
    var objectname=newObject();

Here, new keyword is used to create object.

Example:

            var emp=new Object();
            emp.id=101;
            emp.name="xxx"
            emp.salary=50000;

Accessing JavaScript Objects:

The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:

objectName.property

or

objectName[“property”]

Accessing ‘fname’ from example 1 using dot operator,
   
            person.fname

Accessing ‘name’ form example 2 using [],
            
            emp["name"]
