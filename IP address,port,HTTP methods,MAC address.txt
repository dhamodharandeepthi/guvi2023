IP address,port,HTTP methods,MAC address


IP address:

IP address stands for “Internet Protocol address.” The Internet Protocol is a set of rules for communication over the internet, such as sending mail, streaming video, or connecting to a website. An IP address identifies a network or device on the internet.

IPport:

The port number is “tacked on” to the end of the IP address, for example, “192.168. 1.67:80” shows both the IP address and port number. When data arrives at a device, the network software looks at the port number and sends it to the right program. To find a port address, review an app's technical documentation.

HTTP methods:

The primary or most commonly-used HTTP methods are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These methods correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively.

GET − Provides a read only access to a resource.
POST − Used to create a new resource.
DELETE − Used to remove a resource.
PUT − Used to update a existing resource or create a new resource.
PATCH − applies partial modifications to a resource.

MAC address:

A MAC address (media access control address) is a 12-digit hexadecimal number assigned to each device connected to the network. Primarily specified as a unique identifier during device manufacturing, the MAC address is often found on a device's network interface card (NIC).

The MAC address is a device's physical address, which uniquely identifies it on a specific network. MAC is short for Media Access Control and is also referred to as a hardware address, physical address, or burned-in address (BIA). The MAC address works on the OSI model's data link layer.
